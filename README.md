# BPJS-Mono

I already give Query Database Struct and Postman Documentation in this Project. You can find them at documentation folder

I give Intruction for runnning this Apps :
1. You must already Import Query Database and Postman Documentation
2. You must setup your local enviroment. I give file ".env example", you can change MYSQL_USERNAME and MYSQL_PASSWORD like your local Database enviroment
3. Right now you can run this Apps using command "go run server.go", i recommend you to use Visual Studio Code or VSCode cause in that IDE have terminal and you can see the log every your proses
4. Last but not least, Hit API using postman and Ta-da!!! you got the response and make record in Database

Thank You !!! :)
